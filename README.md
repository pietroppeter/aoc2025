# Advent Of Code 2025

Squeezing some time in to do advent of code.
Since I am faster with Nim than with any other language (e.g. Python), doing it in Nim.

Notes:

- day03: enjoyed part2 (sorting played a role)
- day06: parsing by hand (which is nice and straightforward in nim) resulted in parse2 parsing being shorter than parse1
- day07: enjoyed making minimal changes (adding a timeline counter) to my part1 code
